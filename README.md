## Installation

Start with [**Python>=3.9**](https://www.python.org/) environment.

If you want to run the YOLOv8, YOLOv9 or YOLOv10 examples:

```

cd boxmot
pip install poetry
poetry install --with yolo  # installed boxmot + yolo dependencies
poetry shell  # activates the newly created environment with the installed dependencies
```

but if you only want to import the tracking modules you can simply:

```
pip install boxmot
```
